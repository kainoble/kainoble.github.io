            <h2>Tactics</h2>
            <p>Tactics in football refer to the strategy and methods used by a team to achieve their objectives during a match. Here are some common tactics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Possession Football:</strong> This tactic focuses on keeping control of the ball, reducing the opponent's chances to attack. Teams often pass the ball frequently to retain possession.</li>
                <li><strong>Counter-Attacking:</strong> This strategy involves allowing the opponent to control the ball and territory, then quickly attacking when possession is won, often exploiting the opponent's defensive weaknesses.</li>
                <li><strong>High Press:</strong> Teams using this tactic apply intense pressure on the opponent high up the pitch to win the ball back quickly and create scoring opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Defensive Football:</strong> Focuses on preventing the opponent from scoring by maintaining a strong defensive structure and minimizing gaps in the defense.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Formations</h2>
            <p>Formations determine the positions of players on the pitch and are crucial in implementing tactical strategies. Some common formations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4-4-2:</strong> Four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. This balanced formation is known for its simplicity and flexibility in both defense and attack.</li>
                <li><strong>4-3-3:</strong> Four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. This formation emphasizes attacking play and width, with wingers playing a key role.</li>
                <li><strong>3-5-2:</strong> Three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards. This formation provides strength in midfield and allows wing-backs to contribute to both defense and attack.</li>
                <li><strong>5-3-2:</strong> Five defenders, three midfielders, and two forwards. Often used to create a solid defensive base while allowing for counter-attacks.</li>
            </ul>
