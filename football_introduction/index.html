            <h2>History and Origins</h2>
            <p><strong>Origins of Football:</strong></p>
            <p>Football, also known as soccer, has ancient origins with evidence of similar games played in Greece, Rome, and China. The modern form of the game started in England in the mid-19th century.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Historical Milestones:</strong></p>

                <li><strong>1863:</strong> The Football Association (FA) was formed in England, establishing standardized rules.</li>

            <h2>Basic Overview and Objectives</h2>
            <p><strong>Overview of Football:</strong></p>
            <p>Football is a team sport played with a spherical ball by two teams of eleven players each. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's net.</p>
            <p><strong>Game Structure:</strong></p>
            <p>Matches are played in two halves of 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute halftime break. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Rules:</strong></p>
            <p>Players cannot use their hands or arms to play the ball, except for the goalkeeper within the penalty area. The offside rule prevents players from gaining an unfair advantage by being closer to the opponent’s goal than both the ball and the second-last defender when the ball is played to them.</p>
