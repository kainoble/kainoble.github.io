            <h2>Goalkeeper</h2>
            <p>The goalkeeper is the last line of defense and is the only player allowed to use their hands and arms, but only within the penalty area. Their primary role is to prevent the opposing team from scoring by catching, palming, or punching the ball away from the goal.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Defenders</h2>
            <p>Defenders are responsible for stopping the opposing team from attacking. There are several types of defenders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Center-backs:</strong> Positioned in the central part of the defense. Their main job is to block attackers and win headers.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-backs:</strong> Positioned on either side of the defense. They mark opposing wingers and often join the attack by providing crosses from the flanks.</li>
                <li><strong>Wing-backs:</strong> Similar to full-backs but more involved in offensive play, often in formations that use three central defenders.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Midfielders</h2>
            <p>Midfielders connect defense and attack, often controlling the flow of the game. They come in various types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Defensive Midfielders:</strong> Positioned in front of the defenders to provide extra protection and break up opposition attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Midfielders:</strong> Often box-to-box players who support both defense and attack, distributing the ball and maintaining possession.</li>
                <li><strong>Attacking Midfielders:</strong> Positioned behind the forwards, they create goal-scoring opportunities with passes, dribbles, and shots.</li>
                <li><strong>Wide Midfielders/Wingers:</strong> Positioned on the flanks, they provide width, deliver crosses, and take on defenders.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Forwards</h2>
            <p>Forwards are primarily responsible for scoring goals. There are several types of forwards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strikers:</strong> Main goal-scorers, positioned centrally and close to the opponent's goal. They finish attacks by shooting.</li>
                <li><strong>Center Forwards:</strong> Similar to strikers but may also play with their back to the goal, holding up the ball and bringing others into play.</li>
                <li><strong>Second Strikers:</strong> Play off the main striker, often linking play between midfield and attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Wingers:</strong> Positioned wide in the attacking third, they deliver crosses, dribble past defenders, and cut inside to shoot.</li>
            </ul>
